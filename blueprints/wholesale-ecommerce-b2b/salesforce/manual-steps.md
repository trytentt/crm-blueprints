# Manual steps: Wholesale and ecommerce brand, B2B (salesforce)

Generated from `design.yaml`. Do not edit by hand. The metadata deploy cannot do any of this, or the research has not proven it. Setup paths come from general platform knowledge and labels move between releases.
Sources: `platforms/salesforce/reference/` (api-coverage.md, open-questions.md, automation.md).

## Before and during the build

### 1. Check the Salesforce edition

- [ ] Where: Setup, Company Information, Organization Edition
- Why it is manual: The Metadata API deploys only on Enterprise, Unlimited, Performance and Developer Edition. Professional and Essentials cannot deploy this folder: build by hand from build-sheet.md instead (Professional allows about 50 custom objects and 100 custom fields per object; Essentials allows no custom objects). This blueprint needs 2 custom objects (including 0 junction) and up to 14 custom fields on one object. Allowances are secondary-source figures, so confirm them on the Company Information page.
- Done when: the edition is one of the four, or the by-hand fallback is agreed with the client.

### 2. Run a check-only deploy, then deploy

- [ ] Where: Terminal, in this folder
- Why it is manual: Run `sf project deploy start --dry-run --manifest package.xml --target-org <alias> --api-version 67.0 --wait 30`. Read every error. Then run the same command without `--dry-run`. Use a sandbox first. Never pass `--ignore-errors`, `--ignore-conflicts` or `--ignore-warnings`.
- Done when: the dry run passes and the real deploy lists every file as Created or Unchanged.

### 3. Confirm the deploying user's permissions

- [ ] Where: Setup, Users, Profiles or Permission Sets
- Why it is manual: The user needs API Enabled plus Modify Metadata Through Metadata API Functions or Modify All Data.
- Done when: a check-only deploy starts without a permissions error.

## Check on the first deploy (unverified in the research)

### 4. Deploy one field of each type first

- [ ] Where: Terminal
- Why it is manual: Minimal files for Checkbox, Lookup, MasterDetail and LongTextArea, and the precision and scale limits, are taken from real files but not proven for API 67.0 (research E1). A required Lookup is never emitted.
- Done when: the dry run accepts every field type this blueprint uses.

### 5. Check record type picklist values

- [ ] Where: Setup, Object Manager, the object, Record Types
- Why it is manual: Each record type lists every value of every picklist. Whether omitting a picklist hides its values is unconfirmed (research E4).
- Done when: each record type shows the full list of values for each picklist.

### 6. Check the sales process minimum

- [ ] Where: Setup, Feature Settings, Sales, Sales Processes
- Why it is manual: Each sales process has one open, one won and one lost stage, but the minimum is not stated in the guide (research E9).
- Done when: every sales process saves and shows its stages.

### 7. Check the paths

- [ ] Where: Setup, User Interface, Path Settings
- Why it is manual: A path names its record type. Path preference is on by default only in Enterprise Edition. The `recordTypeName` form is unverified for objects with no record type (research E11).
- Done when: each path shows its stages with the guidance text, for a user of that record type.

### 8. Check the list views

- [ ] Where: Setup, Object Manager, the object, List Views, or the list controls
- Why it is manual: The share target (`allInternalUsers`), the stage filter token `OPPORTUNITY.STAGE_NAME`, blank tests (`equals` with an empty value) and date literals (`TODAY`, `NEXT_N_DAYS:n`) are unverified (research E12). Retrieve a hand-made view to compare.
- Done when: each generated view is visible to internal users and filters as designed.

### 9. Check the permission set

- [ ] Where: Setup, Users, Permission Sets
- Why it is manual: The set grants object access with the field access because a field permission may need object read in the same file (research E16). Required fields and master-detail fields are left out; they follow the object.
- Done when: a test user with the set sees and edits every custom field that is not required.

## Pipelines and stages

### 10. Deactivate the unused default stages

- [ ] Where: Setup, Object Manager, Opportunity, Fields & Relationships, Stage
- Why it is manual: A deploy only adds stage values. Salesforce's default stages stay in the master list (research E10). The sales processes hide them from users, so this is optional tidying. A stage whose label matches a default (for example Closed won and Closed Won) may update that value instead of adding one.
- Done when: only the stages in this design are active, or the client has agreed to leave the defaults.

### 11. Finish the Order status pipeline on Wholesale order

- [ ] Where: Setup, Object Manager, Wholesale order
- Why it is manual: Wholesale order has no native stage machinery. The generator wrote the restricted picklist `Stage__c` and the stage gates. It cannot express won and lost as flags, probability (Placed 40%, Confirmed 60%, Picking 75%, Shipped 90%, Delivered and paid 100%, Cancelled 0%) or forecast categories. Report on the stage values instead, or add a Percent field and a flow to set it. No path is generated for this object: create one under Setup, User Interface, Path Settings, after adding a record type.
- Done when: reports group by stage and the client has said how won, lost and probability are read.

### 12. Check that every Opportunity user has a record type

- [ ] Where: Setup, Users, Permission Sets
- Why it is manual: A record type binds a user to a sales process. The permission set makes each record type visible; users without it fall back to their profile's default record type.
- Done when: a test user creates a deal in each pipeline and sees only that pipeline's stages.

## Stage gates

### 13. Decide how imports pass the stage gates

- [ ] Where: Setup, Custom Code, Custom Permissions
- Why it is manual: Validation rules also fire on API and bulk writes. A data import of records past a gated stage fails unless the gate has an escape hatch (for example a bypass checkbox or custom permission). Not designed here.
- Done when: the import plan names how gated records are loaded.

## Fields, relationships and objects

### 14. Add Territory to a tab and an app

- [ ] Where: Setup, User Interface, Tabs; Setup, Apps, App Manager
- Why it is manual: A custom object is not in the navigation until it has a tab in an app. The minimal tab file is unproven, so it is not generated (research E6).
- Done when: users find Territories from the app's navigation.

### 15. Add Wholesale order to a tab and an app

- [ ] Where: Setup, User Interface, Tabs; Setup, Apps, App Manager
- Why it is manual: A custom object is not in the navigation until it has a tab in an app. The minimal tab file is unproven, so it is not generated (research E6).
- Done when: users find Wholesale orders from the app's navigation.

### 16. Put the new fields on the Account page layout

- [ ] Where: Setup, Object Manager, Account, Page Layouts
- Why it is manual: A deploy creates fields but does not place them on a layout, and a deployed layout would replace the whole one (research E5). The permission set grants access; the layout decides what users see.
- Done when: the Account layout shows every field from this blueprint in a sensible section.

### 17. Put the new fields on the Opportunity page layout

- [ ] Where: Setup, Object Manager, Opportunity, Page Layouts
- Why it is manual: A deploy creates fields but does not place them on a layout, and a deployed layout would replace the whole one (research E5). The permission set grants access; the layout decides what users see.
- Done when: the Opportunity layout shows every field from this blueprint in a sensible section.

### 18. Put the new fields on the Contact page layout

- [ ] Where: Setup, Object Manager, Contact, Page Layouts
- Why it is manual: A deploy creates fields but does not place them on a layout, and a deployed layout would replace the whole one (research E5). The permission set grants access; the layout decides what users see.
- Done when: the Contact layout shows every field from this blueprint in a sensible section.

### 19. Put the new fields on the Territory page layout

- [ ] Where: Setup, Object Manager, Territory, Page Layouts
- Why it is manual: A deploy creates fields but does not place them on a layout, and a deployed layout would replace the whole one (research E5). The permission set grants access; the layout decides what users see.
- Done when: the Territory layout shows every field from this blueprint in a sensible section.

### 20. Put the new fields on the Wholesale order page layout

- [ ] Where: Setup, Object Manager, Wholesale order, Page Layouts
- Why it is manual: A deploy creates fields but does not place them on a layout, and a deployed layout would replace the whole one (research E5). The permission set grants access; the layout decides what users see.
- Done when: the Wholesale order layout shows every field from this blueprint in a sensible section.

### 21. Map lead fields if the client uses Leads

- [ ] Where: Setup, Object Manager, Lead, Fields & Relationships, Map Lead Fields
- Why it is manual: Only custom fields can be mapped, and the metadata path for the mapping file is unverified (research E14). Map any custom Lead field to its Account, Contact or Opportunity field from this blueprint. Standard mappings are fixed.
- Done when: a test lead converts and the custom values carry over, or the client does not use Leads.

## Flows

### 22. Update retailer on order

- [ ] Where: Setup, Process Automation, Flows, New Flow, Record-Triggered Flow
- Why it is manual: Flows are not generated: a wrong flow runs on every save and cannot be removed from source. Trigger: A wholesale order is created. Action: Set the company's last order date, add one to its order count, set first order date if empty, and set its account status to active. In production, a flow deploys inactive unless Setup, Process Automation, Process Automation Settings has 'Deploy processes and flows as active' on.
- Done when: the flow runs once on a test record and does nothing else.

### 23. Close deal on first order

- [ ] Where: Setup, Process Automation, Flows, New Flow, Record-Triggered Flow
- Why it is manual: Flows are not generated: a wrong flow runs on every save and cannot be removed from source. Trigger: A first order linked to an account-acquisition deal moves to confirmed. Action: Move the deal to account opened and set the company account status to onboarding. In production, a flow deploys inactive unless Setup, Process Automation, Process Automation Settings has 'Deploy processes and flows as active' on.
- Done when: the flow runs once on a test record and does nothing else.

### 24. Reorder nudge

- [ ] Where: Setup, Process Automation, Flows, New Flow, Record-Triggered Flow
- Why it is manual: Flows are not generated: a wrong flow runs on every save and cannot be removed from source. Trigger: Days since the last order exceed the retailer's reorder cycle and the account is active. Action: Create a task for the account rep to contact the buyer and set the account status to at risk. In production, a flow deploys inactive unless Setup, Process Automation, Process Automation Settings has 'Deploy processes and flows as active' on.
- Done when: the flow runs once on a test record and does nothing else.

### 25. Second order check

- [ ] Where: Setup, Process Automation, Flows, New Flow, Record-Triggered Flow
- Why it is manual: Flows are not generated: a wrong flow runs on every save and cannot be removed from source. Trigger: A retailer's first order was delivered 45 days ago and its order count is 1. Action: Create a task for the account rep to ask for feedback and a reorder. In production, a flow deploys inactive unless Setup, Process Automation, Process Automation Settings has 'Deploy processes and flows as active' on.
- Done when: the flow runs once on a test record and does nothing else.

### 26. Mark lapsed

- [ ] Where: Setup, Process Automation, Flows, New Flow, Record-Triggered Flow
- Why it is manual: Flows are not generated: a wrong flow runs on every save and cannot be removed from source. Trigger: A retailer has no order for twice its reorder cycle. Action: Set the account status to lapsed and notify the territory rep. In production, a flow deploys inactive unless Setup, Process Automation, Process Automation Settings has 'Deploy processes and flows as active' on.
- Done when: the flow runs once on a test record and does nothing else.

### 27. Vacant territory alert

- [ ] Where: Setup, Process Automation, Flows, New Flow, Record-Triggered Flow
- Why it is manual: Flows are not generated: a wrong flow runs on every save and cannot be removed from source. Trigger: A territory status changes to vacant. Action: Notify the sales manager and reassign its open deals to the manager. In production, a flow deploys inactive unless Setup, Process Automation, Process Automation Settings has 'Deploy processes and flows as active' on.
- Done when: the flow runs once on a test record and does nothing else.

## List views

### 28. Build the view My retailers

- [ ] Where: Companies, List View Controls, New
- Why it is manual: The filter is not a plain comparison on a custom field, the stage or the owner, so it is not generated. Filter: Account rep is me and account status is active, onboarding or at risk. Sort: Last order date, oldest first.
- Done when: the saved view shows the expected records in the stated order.

### 29. Build the view Reorders overdue

- [ ] Where: Companies, List View Controls, New
- Why it is manual: The filter is not a plain comparison on a custom field, the stage or the owner, so it is not generated. Filter: Account status is active or at risk and last order date is older than the reorder cycle. Sort: Last order date, oldest first.
- Done when: the saved view shows the expected records in the stated order.

### 30. Build the view One-order retailers

- [ ] Where: Companies, List View Controls, New
- Why it is manual: The filter is not a plain comparison on a custom field, the stage or the owner, so it is not generated. Filter: Orders to date is 1 and first order date is more than 45 days ago. Sort: First order date, oldest first.
- Done when: the saved view shows the expected records in the stated order.

### 31. Build the view Open orders

- [ ] Where: Wholesale orders, List View Controls, New
- Why it is manual: The filter is not a plain comparison on a custom field, the stage or the owner, so it is not generated. Filter: Status is not delivered or cancelled. Sort: Ship date, soonest first.
- Done when: the saved view shows the expected records in the stated order.

### 32. Set the sort on Territory overview

- [ ] Where: Territories, the list view `Territory_overview`, List View Controls
- Why it is manual: List views have no sort in the metadata. Sort: Name, A to Z.
- Done when: the saved view sorts as stated.

### 33. Set the sort on My retailer pipeline

- [ ] Where: Deals, the list view `Retailer_pipeline`, List View Controls
- Why it is manual: List views have no sort in the metadata. Sort: Next step date, soonest first.
- Done when: the saved view sorts as stated.

## Permissions and access

### 34. Assign the permission set Wholesale_and_ecommerce_brand_B2B_user

- [ ] Where: Setup, Users, Permission Sets, Manage Assignments
- Why it is manual: Assigning a permission set is a data operation, not metadata. A new field is invisible until a profile or permission set grants it. Never ship profiles from here: a profile deploy overwrites far more.
- Done when: a non-admin test user sees and edits the blueprint's fields.

### 35. Set sharing for the standard objects

- [ ] Where: Setup, Security, Sharing Settings
- Why it is manual: Sharing for custom objects is set in the object files (public read and write). Standard objects need the org-wide defaults chosen by the client.
- Done when: the client has signed off the org-wide defaults.
