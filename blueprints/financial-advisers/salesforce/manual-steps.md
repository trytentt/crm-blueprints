# Manual steps: Financial advisers, client households (salesforce)

Generated from `design.yaml`. Do not edit by hand. The metadata deploy cannot do any of this, or the research has not proven it. Setup paths come from general platform knowledge and labels move between releases.
Sources: `platforms/salesforce/reference/` (api-coverage.md, open-questions.md, automation.md).

## Before and during the build

### 1. Check the Salesforce edition

- [ ] Where: Setup, Company Information, Organization Edition
- Why it is manual: The Metadata API deploys only on Enterprise, Unlimited, Performance and Developer Edition. Professional and Essentials cannot deploy this folder: build by hand from build-sheet.md instead (Professional allows about 50 custom objects and 100 custom fields per object; Essentials allows no custom objects). This blueprint needs 3 custom objects (including 0 junction) and up to 11 custom fields on one object. Allowances are secondary-source figures, so confirm them on the Company Information page.
- Done when: the edition is one of the four, or the by-hand fallback is agreed with the client.

### 2. Run a check-only deploy, then deploy

- [ ] Where: Terminal, in this folder
- Why it is manual: Run `sf project deploy start --dry-run --manifest package.xml --target-org <alias> --api-version 67.0 --wait 30`. Read every error. Then run the same command without `--dry-run`. Use a sandbox first. Never pass `--ignore-errors`, `--ignore-conflicts` or `--ignore-warnings`.
- Done when: the dry run passes and the real deploy lists every file as Created or Unchanged.

### 3. Confirm the deploying user's permissions

- [ ] Where: Setup, Users, Profiles or Permission Sets
- Why it is manual: The user needs API Enabled plus Modify Metadata Through Metadata API Functions or Modify All Data.
- Done when: a check-only deploy starts without a permissions error.

## Check on the first deploy (unverified in the research)

### 4. Deploy one field of each type first

- [ ] Where: Terminal
- Why it is manual: Minimal files for Checkbox, Lookup, MasterDetail and LongTextArea, and the precision and scale limits, are taken from real files but not proven for API 67.0 (research E1). A required Lookup is never emitted.
- Done when: the dry run accepts every field type this blueprint uses.

### 5. Check record type picklist values

- [ ] Where: Setup, Object Manager, the object, Record Types
- Why it is manual: Each record type lists every value of every picklist. Whether omitting a picklist hides its values is unconfirmed (research E4).
- Done when: each record type shows the full list of values for each picklist.

### 6. Check the sales process minimum

- [ ] Where: Setup, Feature Settings, Sales, Sales Processes
- Why it is manual: Each sales process has one open, one won and one lost stage, but the minimum is not stated in the guide (research E9).
- Done when: every sales process saves and shows its stages.

### 7. Check the paths

- [ ] Where: Setup, User Interface, Path Settings
- Why it is manual: A path names its record type. Path preference is on by default only in Enterprise Edition. The `recordTypeName` form is unverified for objects with no record type (research E11).
- Done when: each path shows its stages with the guidance text, for a user of that record type.

### 8. Check the list views

- [ ] Where: Setup, Object Manager, the object, List Views, or the list controls
- Why it is manual: The share target (`allInternalUsers`), the stage filter token `OPPORTUNITY.STAGE_NAME`, blank tests (`equals` with an empty value) and date literals (`TODAY`, `NEXT_N_DAYS:n`) are unverified (research E12). Retrieve a hand-made view to compare.
- Done when: each generated view is visible to internal users and filters as designed.

### 9. Check the permission set

- [ ] Where: Setup, Users, Permission Sets
- Why it is manual: The set grants object access with the field access because a field permission may need object read in the same file (research E16). Required fields and master-detail fields are left out; they follow the object.
- Done when: a test user with the set sees and edits every custom field that is not required.

### 10. Check the data classification elements

- [ ] Where: Setup, Object Manager, the field, Edit
- Why it is manual: Fields flagged as data protection carry `complianceGroup` PII;GDPR and a `securityClassification`. These are labels, not encryption. Shield Platform Encryption is a separate paid feature. Confirm API 67.0 accepts them.
- Done when: the flagged fields deploy and show the compliance categorisation.

## Pipelines and stages

### 11. Deactivate the unused default stages

- [ ] Where: Setup, Object Manager, Opportunity, Fields & Relationships, Stage
- Why it is manual: A deploy only adds stage values. Salesforce's default stages stay in the master list (research E10). The sales processes hide them from users, so this is optional tidying. A stage whose label matches a default (for example Closed won and Closed Won) may update that value instead of adding one.
- Done when: only the stages in this design are active, or the client has agreed to leave the defaults.

### 12. Finish the Advice delivery pipeline on Advice case

- [ ] Where: Setup, Object Manager, Advice case
- Why it is manual: Advice case has no native stage machinery. The generator wrote the restricted picklist `Stage__c` and the stage gates. It cannot express won and lost as flags, probability (Fact find 20%, Analysis 40%, Report drafted 60%, Report issued 75%, Accepted 90%, Completed 100%, Closed without advice 0%) or forecast categories. Report on the stage values instead, or add a Percent field and a flow to set it. No path is generated for this object: create one under Setup, User Interface, Path Settings, after adding a record type.
- Done when: reports group by stage and the client has said how won, lost and probability are read.

### 13. Finish the Review cycle pipeline on Review

- [ ] Where: Setup, Object Manager, Review
- Why it is manual: Review has no native stage machinery. The generator wrote the restricted picklist `Stage__c` and the stage gates. It cannot express won and lost as flags, probability (Due 20%, Invited 40%, Booked 60%, Meeting held 80%, Review completed 100%, Not completed 0%) or forecast categories. Report on the stage values instead, or add a Percent field and a flow to set it. No path is generated for this object: create one under Setup, User Interface, Path Settings, after adding a record type.
- Done when: reports group by stage and the client has said how won, lost and probability are read.

### 14. Check that every Opportunity user has a record type

- [ ] Where: Setup, Users, Permission Sets
- Why it is manual: A record type binds a user to a sales process. The permission set makes each record type visible; users without it fall back to their profile's default record type.
- Done when: a test user creates a deal in each pipeline and sees only that pipeline's stages.

## Stage gates

### 15. Decide how imports pass the stage gates

- [ ] Where: Setup, Custom Code, Custom Permissions
- Why it is manual: Validation rules also fire on API and bulk writes. A data import of records past a gated stage fails unless the gate has an escape hatch (for example a bypass checkbox or custom permission). Not designed here.
- Done when: the import plan names how gated records are loaded.

## Fields, relationships and objects

### 16. Add Household to a tab and an app

- [ ] Where: Setup, User Interface, Tabs; Setup, Apps, App Manager
- Why it is manual: A custom object is not in the navigation until it has a tab in an app. The minimal tab file is unproven, so it is not generated (research E6).
- Done when: users find Households from the app's navigation.

### 17. Add Advice case to a tab and an app

- [ ] Where: Setup, User Interface, Tabs; Setup, Apps, App Manager
- Why it is manual: A custom object is not in the navigation until it has a tab in an app. The minimal tab file is unproven, so it is not generated (research E6).
- Done when: users find Advice cases from the app's navigation.

### 18. Add Review to a tab and an app

- [ ] Where: Setup, User Interface, Tabs; Setup, Apps, App Manager
- Why it is manual: A custom object is not in the navigation until it has a tab in an app. The minimal tab file is unproven, so it is not generated (research E6).
- Done when: users find Reviews from the app's navigation.

### 19. Put the new fields on the Advice case page layout

- [ ] Where: Setup, Object Manager, Advice case, Page Layouts
- Why it is manual: A deploy creates fields but does not place them on a layout, and a deployed layout would replace the whole one (research E5). The permission set grants access; the layout decides what users see.
- Done when: the Advice case layout shows every field from this blueprint in a sensible section.

### 20. Put the new fields on the Account page layout

- [ ] Where: Setup, Object Manager, Account, Page Layouts
- Why it is manual: A deploy creates fields but does not place them on a layout, and a deployed layout would replace the whole one (research E5). The permission set grants access; the layout decides what users see.
- Done when: the Account layout shows every field from this blueprint in a sensible section.

### 21. Put the new fields on the Opportunity page layout

- [ ] Where: Setup, Object Manager, Opportunity, Page Layouts
- Why it is manual: A deploy creates fields but does not place them on a layout, and a deployed layout would replace the whole one (research E5). The permission set grants access; the layout decides what users see.
- Done when: the Opportunity layout shows every field from this blueprint in a sensible section.

### 22. Put the new fields on the Household page layout

- [ ] Where: Setup, Object Manager, Household, Page Layouts
- Why it is manual: A deploy creates fields but does not place them on a layout, and a deployed layout would replace the whole one (research E5). The permission set grants access; the layout decides what users see.
- Done when: the Household layout shows every field from this blueprint in a sensible section.

### 23. Put the new fields on the Contact page layout

- [ ] Where: Setup, Object Manager, Contact, Page Layouts
- Why it is manual: A deploy creates fields but does not place them on a layout, and a deployed layout would replace the whole one (research E5). The permission set grants access; the layout decides what users see.
- Done when: the Contact layout shows every field from this blueprint in a sensible section.

### 24. Put the new fields on the Review page layout

- [ ] Where: Setup, Object Manager, Review, Page Layouts
- Why it is manual: A deploy creates fields but does not place them on a layout, and a deployed layout would replace the whole one (research E5). The permission set grants access; the layout decides what users see.
- Done when: the Review layout shows every field from this blueprint in a sensible section.

### 25. Map lead fields if the client uses Leads

- [ ] Where: Setup, Object Manager, Lead, Fields & Relationships, Map Lead Fields
- Why it is manual: Only custom fields can be mapped, and the metadata path for the mapping file is unverified (research E14). Map any custom Lead field to its Account, Contact or Opportunity field from this blueprint. Standard mappings are fixed.
- Done when: a test lead converts and the custom values carry over, or the client does not use Leads.

## Flows

### 26. Start advice case on client won

- [ ] Where: Setup, Process Automation, Flows, New Flow, Record-Triggered Flow
- Why it is manual: Flows are not generated: a wrong flow runs on every save and cannot be removed from source. Trigger: A deal in the new client pipeline moves to client won. Action: Set the household status to onboarding, set the agreement date, create an advice case at fact find assigned to the lead adviser, and set the next review date from the review frequency. In production, a flow deploys inactive unless Setup, Process Automation, Process Automation Settings has 'Deploy processes and flows as active' on.
- Done when: the flow runs once on a test record and does nothing else.

### 27. Open review

- [ ] Where: Setup, Process Automation, Flows, New Flow, Record-Triggered Flow
- Why it is manual: Flows are not generated: a wrong flow runs on every save and cannot be removed from source. Trigger: A household's next review date is 90 days away and its status is ongoing client. Action: Create a review at due for the household, assigned to the lead adviser. In production, a flow deploys inactive unless Setup, Process Automation, Process Automation Settings has 'Deploy processes and flows as active' on.
- Done when: the flow runs once on a test record and does nothing else.

### 28. Roll the review cycle forward

- [ ] Where: Setup, Process Automation, Flows, New Flow, Record-Triggered Flow
- Why it is manual: Flows are not generated: a wrong flow runs on every save and cannot be removed from source. Trigger: A review moves to review completed. Action: Set the household's last review date to the meeting date and its next review date to the date plus its review frequency. In production, a flow deploys inactive unless Setup, Process Automation, Process Automation Settings has 'Deploy processes and flows as active' on.
- Done when: the flow runs once on a test record and does nothing else.

### 29. Chase overdue reviews

- [ ] Where: Setup, Process Automation, Flows, New Flow, Record-Triggered Flow
- Why it is manual: Flows are not generated: a wrong flow runs on every save and cannot be removed from source. Trigger: A review is open and its due date has passed. Action: Notify the lead adviser and add the review to the overdue reviews view. In production, a flow deploys inactive unless Setup, Process Automation, Process Automation Settings has 'Deploy processes and flows as active' on.
- Done when: the flow runs once on a test record and does nothing else.

### 30. Vulnerability flag alert

- [ ] Where: Setup, Process Automation, Flows, New Flow, Record-Triggered Flow
- Why it is manual: Flows are not generated: a wrong flow runs on every save and cannot be removed from source. Trigger: A person's vulnerability flag changes to possible or confirmed. Action: Notify the lead adviser and compliance lead to check the service and communication preferences. In production, a flow deploys inactive unless Setup, Process Automation, Process Automation Settings has 'Deploy processes and flows as active' on.
- Done when: the flow runs once on a test record and does nothing else.

### 31. Compliance check request

- [ ] Where: Setup, Process Automation, Flows, New Flow, Record-Triggered Flow
- Why it is manual: Flows are not generated: a wrong flow runs on every save and cannot be removed from source. Trigger: An advice case moves to report drafted. Action: Notify the compliance lead and set the compliance check to pending. In production, a flow deploys inactive unless Setup, Process Automation, Process Automation Settings has 'Deploy processes and flows as active' on.
- Done when: the flow runs once on a test record and does nothing else.

### 32. Thank the referrer

- [ ] Where: Setup, Process Automation, Flows, New Flow, Record-Triggered Flow
- Why it is manual: Flows are not generated: a wrong flow runs on every save and cannot be removed from source. Trigger: A deal with a professional referral source moves to client won. Action: Create a task for the lead adviser to thank the referrer, subject to the referral agreement and client consent. In production, a flow deploys inactive unless Setup, Process Automation, Process Automation Settings has 'Deploy processes and flows as active' on.
- Done when: the flow runs once on a test record and does nothing else.

## List views

### 33. Set the sort on Reviews due in 90 days

- [ ] Where: Households, the list view `Reviews_due_90_days`, List View Controls
- Why it is manual: List views have no sort in the metadata. Sort: Next review date, soonest first.
- Done when: the saved view sorts as stated.

### 34. Build the view Overdue reviews

- [ ] Where: Reviews, List View Controls, New
- Why it is manual: The filter is not a plain comparison on a custom field, the stage or the owner, so it is not generated. Filter: Review is open and due date is in the past. Sort: Due date, oldest first.
- Done when: the saved view shows the expected records in the stated order.

### 35. Build the view My advice cases

- [ ] Where: Advice cases, List View Controls, New
- Why it is manual: The filter is not a plain comparison on a custom field, the stage or the owner, so it is not generated. Filter: Adviser or paraplanner is me and stage is open. Sort: Report issued date, oldest first.
- Done when: the saved view shows the expected records in the stated order.

### 36. Set the sort on My prospects

- [ ] Where: Deals, the list view `New_client_pipeline`, List View Controls
- Why it is manual: List views have no sort in the metadata. Sort: Next step date, soonest first.
- Done when: the saved view sorts as stated.

### 37. Set the sort on Clients with a vulnerability flag

### 38. Set the sort on Households by service tier

- [ ] Where: Households, the list view `Households_by_tier`, List View Controls
- Why it is manual: List views have no sort in the metadata. Sort: Service tier, then name.
- Done when: the saved view sorts as stated.

## Permissions and access

### 39. Assign the permission set Financial_advisers_client_households_user

- [ ] Where: Setup, Users, Permission Sets, Manage Assignments
- Why it is manual: Assigning a permission set is a data operation, not metadata. A new field is invisible until a profile or permission set grants it. Never ship profiles from here: a profile deploy overwrites far more.
- Done when: a non-admin test user sees and edits the blueprint's fields.

### 40. Set sharing for the standard objects

- [ ] Where: Setup, Security, Sharing Settings
- Why it is manual: Sharing for custom objects is set in the object files (public read and write). Standard objects need the org-wide defaults chosen by the client.
- Done when: the client has signed off the org-wide defaults.
